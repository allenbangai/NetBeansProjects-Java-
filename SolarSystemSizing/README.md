# SOLAR SYSTEM SIZING
This repository is for the sizing of a solar system with the aim coming up with the following outcomes which can then helps us size a solr system depending on our needs.
To size a solar system for supplying a set of loads, we need to know the total power of each load and their independent hour of autonomy not forgeting the number of each type of load. This data helps us size a suitable solar system using our algorithm. But what more to our algorithm is that there are four different waysin which data can be inputed into our algorithm for sizing your system. 
- First, you can enter the total energy per day and the number of hours of autonomy and if the number of hours of autonomy is not entered, the system uses a default number of autonomy of 8 hours.
- Second, you can enter the total power of the system and the number of hours of autonomy. If the user doesn't enter the number of hours of autonomy, the system choses the default number of hours of autonomy of 8 hours.
- Third, 
At the end of the sizing of our system panel, inverter, battery, charge controller that we have to use.
