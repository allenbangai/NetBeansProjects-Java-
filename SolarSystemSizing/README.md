# SOLAR SYSTEM SIZING
This repository is for the sizing of a solar system with the aim coming up with the outcomes which can then helps us size a solr system depending on our needs.
To size a solar system for supplying a set of loads, we need to know the total power of each load and their independent hour of autonomy not forgeting the number of each type of load. This data helps us size a suitable solar system using our algorithm. But what more to our algorithm is that there are four different waysin which data can be inputed into our algorithm for sizing your system. 
- First: You can enter the total energy per day and the number of hours of autonomy and if the number of hours of autonomy is not entered, the system uses a default number of autonomy of 8 hours.
- Second: You can enter the total power of the system and the number of hours of autonomy. If the user doesn't enter the number of hours of autonomy, the system choses the default number of hours of autonomy of 8 hours.
- Third: Here you can enter the powers of each type load, their numbers and hours of autonomy each. The default number of hours of autonomy is 8 hours. If you have a set of identical loads with the same power rating but you want to have different hours of autonomy, you should enter them as different kind of loads. The same goes for if the loads have different power rating.
- Fourth: Here you can enter the power of each load and their repective number but there is a global number of hours autonomy for all the loads which by default it is 8 hours but can be modified by the user. 
At the end of the sizing of your system using our algorithm, the user will know the panel, inverter, battery, charge controller that he/she  have to use.
Our algorithm consist of the following
## Sizing the total power of the system

## Sizing the energy consumption of the house with a specific hour of autonomy

## Sizing of the Solar panel

## Sizing of the Inverter

## Sizing of the Solar Battery

## Sizing of the Solar Charge Controller
